# FAQs

## What does this do?

This repository stores all the aforementioned links. There's no particular theme to it at this time. Anyone can contribute! If you want to add a category/sub-category, you're free to do so as well. I will clean things up from time to time, however.

## I want to add to these!

Great! Fork it and submit a pull request. I really want this directory to be well-organized and structured, however, so your changes should conform to the current architecture of this document. (Of course, the architecture will change over time.)
